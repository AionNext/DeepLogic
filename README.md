# DeepLogic


AionNEXT Deep Logic enables sophisticated intelligent content of Enterprise Application Software.

Deep Logic is an end-to-end dual AI and Inference engine that provides a complete infrastructure for the development of intelligent content of Enterprise Applications in CD/CI life cycle.

Its best in class, sophisticated and high performance Inference Engine (DL/IE) is capable of processing thousands of rules in three different inferencing scenarios:

forward chaining ; start from the known facts and move forward by applying inference rules to extract more data, and it continues until it reaches to the goal,
backward chaining ; starts from the goal, move backward by using inference rules to determine the facts that satisfy the goal.
pattern matching ; applying inferencing (rule processing) over the sets of data.
In addition, Deep Logic Inference engine is capable of procesing large amount of busines rules in massively parallel scheme over a cluster of computing nodes.

Deep Logic AI Engine (DL/AIE) provides solutions for the following technological challenges:

Data science
Machine/deep learning
Deep Logic capabilities are collectively encompassed within Data Analytics (aka Data Science). The primary subcategories are:
Predictive analytics
Machine learning
Prescriptive analytics
Deep Logic AI capabilities can continually learn and adjust to changing conditions in data.
Here are some ideas for how you could use Deep Logic in a business context:

Pattern recognition. Understand typical trends or behaviors for customer financial transactions and spot anomalies in an account’s spending data to identify potentially fraudulent behavior.
Prediction. Capture short- and long-term variability in data to improve forecasting of energy consumption.
Classification. Spam detection in email service providers can be identified as a classification problem.
Here are a few examples of possible use of Deep Logic based solutions:

Banking. Fraud detection, credit and risk analysis, and market recommendations provided by automated financial advisers.
Health and life sciences. Processing data from past case notes, biomedical imaging and health monitors to advance the use of predictive diagnostics and improve response times in patient care.
Manufacturing and energy. Supply chain optimization, automated detection of defects during production and energy forecasting.
Communications and retail. Improved chat bot functionality, personalized shopping experiences and customized recommendations.
